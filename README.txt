Overview of Module 10.

Module 10 is web scraping data to extract data. Module 10 had us automate a chrome browser. 
it stored the data and then rendered the data through Flask.

The focus to gain a further understanding of HTML elements to identify content to scrape Mars images and Mars Data. 
Tags and HTML IDS are used to identify 

---Project Buildout of the Mars App
	Exploring HTML Elements NASA news website retrieves current components. Components are inspectd with DevTools 
	Splinter and BS4 scraped data through the HTML Tag. 
	Featured images are added to the scrape and the list of dictionar items of Jupyter Notebook output 
	https://github.com/frankxsu11ivan/Mission-to-Mars/tree/main/picts 
	In the template folder is an example of the CCS index stylesheets that were generated. 

---Project Overview of Mars
	WebScraping for online data for analysis (to help with the story) of currnet data regarding Mars.
	the tools are inplace and code written in jupyter Note book, extracted in to VS Code and ran in GitBash.
	a quck three step sequence to scrape. Mars Data and facts are http://127.0.0.1:5000 and image

---Results. 
	working through the module as suto 'Robin' portfolio and for a position with NASA and researching Mars, this is a good excercise.
	breakdown of HTML code expanded my base knowledge. Automated scrape of title and summary with facts is sucessful.
	updating the code was in 10.5.2 was the missing peice to get the list of hemispheres. 
	once the function was added through starter code - it took on a new look.
	I am interested enought to study this further. the base code works and further scraping should be as sucessful as Mod 10.
